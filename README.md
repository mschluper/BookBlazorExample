# BookBlazorExample
Small Blazor app illustrating concepts of book on Application Development. It assumes you use Microsoft Visual Studio (and .NET 7).

It consists of two parts:
1. The app itself;
2. A small console app that does prepares for some requirements coverage reporting.


## BookBlazorExample.sln

The app itself. It's a Blaozr variant of the small app built in **Thinking in React**.

## Requirements Tracer

A small console app that builds the app, runs its tests, gathers requirement coverage data, and outputs it in a Json file. This Json file can then be used by a report on Requirement Coverage. As a matter of fact, the app displays this report.
